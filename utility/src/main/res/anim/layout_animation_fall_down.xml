        <!--There are three types to choose from: normal,reverse and random.
         This allows to control in which order the content will be animated.
          Normal follows the natural order of the layout (vertical: top to bottom, horizontal: left to right),
           Reverse is the opposite of Normal and Random…well Random is random order.-->

        <!--delay-->
        <!--0% will cause all items in the layout to animate simultaneously,
         and 100% will let each item finish it’s animation before the next one is started.
         In this case, 15% of item A’s animation will pass before item B starts its animation.-->
